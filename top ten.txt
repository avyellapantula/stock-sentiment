Alphabet is the parent company of search-engine giant Google. Among its other products besides the Google search engine, Alphabet runs video sharing site YouTube. It's notable that the company splits its stock into two main share classes. Google's C shares are nonvoting shares, meaning they do not entitle the holder to participate in proxy votes. The A shares usually trade for slightly more than the C shares, and carry voting rights. Each of these shares trades on the S&P 500, and each is large enough, by itself, to make the top 10 list. If the two share classes were counted together, it would place Alphabet 4th on this list and would make up 3.6% of the index. There are also B shares, which have disproportionate voting rights and are only held by Google insiders. The B shares do not trade on the open market.
